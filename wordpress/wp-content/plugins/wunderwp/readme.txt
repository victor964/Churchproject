== What is WunderWP? ==

Your Elementor website won’t look good unless you put a lot of time forming the layout, building individual page sections and stylizing the widgets. WunderWP saves you that time:


== Preset widgets styles and section templates ==

Use preset widget styles you can quickly apply to beautify your Elementor widgets. If you’re short on time to deal with individual widgets, you can use one of the WunderWP’s preset section or page templates to quickly put together your content.


== Custom widgets styles and section templates ==

If you like your own widget styles, you can save them in the WunderWP Cloud and apply them an unlimited number of times to similar widgets in other Elementor projects. You can also save an entire section or page template in your custom section templates and reuse them for any Elementor projects.


== It’s free and works perfectly with any Elementor-based theme ==

The WunderWP custom and preset features are fully compatible with any Elementor-based theme. Apply a preset or your custom style to your widget. Alternatively, drag one of your saved custom page or section templates from the WunderWP Cloud to your page and start using. There are more styles and widgets coming every month – and all this is and will be available for free.

**(Custom and Preset section templates feature is available only for Elementor Pro users)**

== Available preset section templates: ==

50 Elements for Elementor Pro

== Available Styles ==

134 Element Styles for Elementor Free
138 Element Styles for Elementor Pro
42 Element Styles for Elementor Raven

**> Find full demo of styles & templates on [WunderWP.com](https://wunderwp.com/)**

== Features ==

- Put together a page quickly with preset content instead of building it from scratch. Drag a preset intro section, about section, a services section or a call-to-ction section to your page and build a beautiful page in seconds.
- Save your page or section templates and reuse them as many times as you want. Just create a section, save it in the WunderWP Cloud and use it infinitely.
- Save your styles in the WunderWP Cloud and then reuse them in any future Elementor project.
- Apply preset and alternative styles for different elements in Elementor Free, Elementor Pro and Raven libraries.
- Download the new Elementor styles added to different collections to WunderWP over time.
