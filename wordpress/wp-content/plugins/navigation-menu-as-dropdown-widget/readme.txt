== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use this widget? =

If you go to Widgets in the Appearance menu, you will be able to drag-and-drop the
'Navigation menu as dropdown' widget to a place of your choosing.

Please give a title (or not) and select the menu to convert to a dropdown.

= Can I also submit a custom start-text? =

Yes you can, when you add the widget you will see that option.

= Can I also preselect the current page? =

Yes you can, there is an option "Preselect the visited page in dropdown" when you add the widget.

= Can I customize the appearance / styling of the dropdown? =

Yes you can, with CSS. If you know your way around CSS you might already know that you can
style elements by their class name or HTML structure. We just have a simple select-element
here. The pages inside (option-elements) have classes. For the upper layer it's `pd_tld`,
the second layer has `pd_sld`.

Styling selects still is hard in current browsers, but this is changing.

I do offer help on styling / CSS if you are willing to make a small donation.

= Does it support more than 1 level in linkstructure? =

No, not at this moment. I will work on that. It currently supports one level of parent-child structure.
